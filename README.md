Bash script that opens files specified in a new terminal window in vim.
By default the script tries to use the default terminal by reading the $TERMINAL variable (you need to setup yourself e.g. by writing "export TERMINAL=<your favourite term emu>" into your .bashrc file) or simply starting up the default terminal emulators on supported DEs/WMs

Currently supporting default terminals of:
- Cinnamon
- GNOME
- i3-wm
- KDE Plasma
- MATE
- XFCE 4

More coming soon
