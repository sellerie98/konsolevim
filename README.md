Bash script that opens files specified in a new terminal window in vim, working around the conflict of gvim and vim (at least under Arch Linux).
By default the script tries to use the default terminal by reading the $TERMINAL variable or simply starting up the default terminal emulators on supported DEs/WMs

Currently supporting default terminals of:
- XFCE
- KDE
- i3-wm

More coming soon
